# ZX Case Study - A diary

## September 14, 2025

Added a diary to track upcoming tasks.
Still to come:

- Complete Excercises on Chapter 10
- Chapter 11 - 16 Bit operations and Software Design concepts
- Chapter 12 - Interrupts Handling
- Develop Pong in Assembly for the Spectrum based on the acquired book.
- Try to study some algorithms for efficient writing on the screen using a preccalulated array of addresses which can be easily used to address pixels without calculating every time the address from the x,y coordinates. so basically a look-up table of addresses that can be addressed as:
-- address (x,y) = baseaddress + content_of_address(x + x_res*y)
