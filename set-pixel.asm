; Takes as input the X and Y positions:
;
;       X=[x7,x6,x5,x4,x3,x2,x1,x0]
;       Y=[y7,y6,y5,y4,y3,y2,y1,y0]
;
;       extracts target register and puts it in HL = [0,1,0,y7,y6,y2,y1,y0][y5,y4,y3,x7,x6,x5,x4,x3]
;       counts the position using [x0,x1,x2] to identify which point in the target address to highlight
;       
;       H Reginster
;       [y7,y6] are defining which block of the three main blocks we are using (00,01,02) => H {%010[00]}... {%010[01]...} {%010[10]...}   {$40} {48} {50}
;       [y2,y1,y0] are defining which row inside of a character we are using, rangin from 0 to 7
;       
;       L Register
;       [y5,y4,y3] are defining which characters row in the block to target from 0 to 7
;       [x7,x6,x5,x4,x3] are definings which character in the targeted characters row to index, from 0 to 31
;
;       L Register extrapolation
;       The algorithm can start from X or Y, we store XY in the BC registers.
;       Start from the X coordinate, putting bits x7,x6,x5,x4,x3 in A and doing a Shift Right Logical Operation, which is setting to 0 the leftmost values/
;       We put the result in L (where it is expected to stay) and then we extract values from Y after masking it with %00111000 as we need [y5,y4,y3]
;       We do an or with L so to get the final expected value
;       
;       H Register extrapolation
;       We do the same for Y values.
;       Take the first [y2,y1,y0] and move them in H after an OR to clear previous values.
;       To take [y7,y6] we do some shift operations to move them in the proper position, and then mask the values, we do an or with %01000000 to include the first 3 bits
;       store everything in H
;
;       Bit shift operations
;       Since we want to move bits around to save some cycles i want the most or less significant buits in shift right and shift left operations to be set to 0
;       So we use the two instructions: 
;
;           SLA -> Shift Left Arithmetic 
;           SRL -> Shift Right Logical
;
;       To pick the right pixel we set a kind of if on the [x2,x1,x0] bits and depoending on the value we set a different value in the target address.
